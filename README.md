## 1) What We Collect

**Account & Profile**
- Email, username/display name, profile photo, bio, and any other details you choose to add.

**User Content**
- Posts, comments, reactions, direct messages, and media you upload.  
- Direct messages are encrypted **in transit and at rest**. Where supported, one-to-one messages use **end-to-end encryption** so only sender and recipient can read them.

**Duplicate-Image Detection (Anti-Spam)**
- When you upload an image, we compute a **non-reversible perceptual hash** (an image ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù).  
- The **same image** may be uploaded **twice**; a **third** attempt is blocked automatically to reduce spam.  
- We store only the fingerprint and minimal counters required to enforce this rule; we **do not** share these fingerprints with third parties.

**Device & Usage**
- App version, OS, crash logs, diagnostics, coarse analytics (e.g., feature usage counts).  
- We **do not** use this data for cross-app tracking or advertising.

**Optional Signals (only if you opt in)**
- Contacts discovery, approximate location in posts, push notification tokens.

**Cookies / Local Storage (web)**
- For sign-in session continuity, security, and basic analytics.
